# Merge Sort Using Recursion
void MergeSort(int arr[], int low, int high); 
where Input: unsorted integer array, starting and ending indexes

In computer science, merge sort is an O(n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted). Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
